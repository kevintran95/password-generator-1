# password-generator-1

## Description
This page is made to be a password generator. When the user first clicks on generate password, a prompt comes on the screen asking the user to select the number of chararcters they want for their password and it must be between 8 and 128 characters long. After that several more confirms will show up on screen asking the user if they would like to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters in their password. Finally, after answering all the questions a random password will generate for the user.

## Issues
Although the password generator is supposed to be to display all sorts of characters, it is only able to make passswords with lowercase letters. I was unable to debug this problem and solve the issue.
